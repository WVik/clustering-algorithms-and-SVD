# clustering-algorithms-and-SVD


### This repository contains the implementation of the research paper on SVD and Clustering.
-------
### Clustering Lage Graphs via the Singular Value Demomposition: ## https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/papers/dfkvv.pdf
-------

The principal implementation of the paper can be found in **main.py** file.

The code uses the graph library _networkx_. To get familiar with the libraries, test code can be found in the _networkxtest.py_ files.

The data set in _data.txt_ was taken from the Stanford SNAP website. The compressed data file is _data.txt.zip_.
Other small datasets for testing are also provided.
